# Econscious
Use Ford SmartDeviceLink API to provide users with tools to be more energy efficient.

Currently, we have three main ways of encouraging energy efficiency.  The first is deciding whether to roll down your window or turn on the air conditioner while trying to cool down the car.  Many factors such as speed, drag, and wind chill effect are taken into consideration for this calculation.  The second is a fuel consumption gauge that keeps the driver aware of their current fuel consumption.  Lastly, we have a tracker to see how many times the driver accelerated extremely quickly.  This idea will eventually expand to the idea of tracking the driver's breaking and acceleration habits to provide feedback on how to drive more energy conciously.
